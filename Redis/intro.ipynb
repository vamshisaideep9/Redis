    "\n",
    "**2. Session Store:** *It's used to manage user sessions in web applications, ensuring fast access and real-time updates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Queues:** *Redis lists and blocking operations make it a popular choice for message queues and task management systems.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Analytics:** *Its data structures and atomic operations can aid in real-time analytics and data processing.*\n",
