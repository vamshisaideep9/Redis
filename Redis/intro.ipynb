    "**Common Use-Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Caching Layer:** *Redis excels as a cache due to its in-memory nature and quick data retrieval, serving as a data source for web servers, databases, and more.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Session Store:** *It's used to manage user sessions in web applications, ensuring fast access and real-time updates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Queues:** *Redis lists and blocking operations make it a popular choice for message queues and task management systems.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Analytics:** *Its data structures and atomic operations can aid in real-time analytics and data processing.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fundamental Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strings\n",
    "2. Lists\n",
    "3. Sets\n",
    "4. Sorted Sets\n",
    "5. Hashes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caching Strategy:** *Redis employs the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm for cache expiration, but allows for more nuanced strategies as well.*"
